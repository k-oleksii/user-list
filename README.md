To get started with the React app, follow the instructions below:

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/k-oleksii/user-list.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd user-list`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Development Server

Run the following command to start the development server:

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app. The page will reload if you make any edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.
